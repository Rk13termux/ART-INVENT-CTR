# Assets Images Directory

This directory contains images for the ATR Inventory Control application.

## Usage
Place your images here and reference them in your Flutter code like:

```dart
Image.asset('assets/images/your_image.png')
```

## Image Guidelines
- Use appropriate formats (PNG, JPG, WebP)
- Provide multiple resolutions (@2x, @3x) when needed
- Optimize file sizes for mobile performance
- Use descriptive naming convention (snake_case)
